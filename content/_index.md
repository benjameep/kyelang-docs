## What is Kye?

Kye is a data engineering tool that provides solid foundations for data pipelines through data contracts, unit tests and much more!

Kye stands for "Know your edges", meaning know the limits of your data transformations. Every program has limits in what it is capable of handling, but rarely are we explicit in defining what those limits are.

When you explicitly model your data it...
1. **Solidifies** the assumptions you make about your data, helping you write better bug-free code.
2. **Frees** you from constantly worrying "what if X happens?" With your assumptions defined you can be rest assured that if your code breaks you'll know about it, and can fix it later.
3. **Communicates** your assumptions to your future self, other developers, and automation tools. Helping them better understand your code, when and where it will break.
